Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
**st-copyout** depends on `dmenu` and `xclip`


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make uninstall
    make clean install
    make clean



If you did not install st with `make clean install`, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
